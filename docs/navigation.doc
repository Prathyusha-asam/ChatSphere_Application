## Root Layout & Navigation Skeleton (NT-7)

### Overview
This user story focuses on setting up the foundational layout and navigation structure for the application. The goal is to ensure that all pages share a consistent layout, global styling, and a common navigation bar, making the application easier to maintain and scale as new features are added.

---

### Purpose
The root layout acts as the backbone of the application. By defining a single layout and navigation component, we avoid duplication, ensure visual consistency, and create a solid base for future enhancements such as authentication-aware navigation and responsive menus.
---

### Implementation Details

#### Root Layout (`app/layout.tsx`)
The root layout is responsible for wrapping every page in the application.

It:
- Defines global metadata such as the application title and description
- Imports global styles and Tailwind CSS
- Renders the navigation bar across all routes
- Provides a consistent structure using the `{children}` pattern

This ensures that every page automatically inherits the same layout and styling without additional setup.

---

#### Navigation Bar (`Navbar` component)
The Navbar component serves as the primary navigation container for the application.

Current functionality includes:
- Displaying the application name/branding
- Providing a placeholder for authentication-based UI
- Planning support for a responsive hamburger menu

---

#### Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)
The Home page acts as the landing page and demonstrates how the layout and navigation work together.

It includes:
- A hero section introducing the platform
- Call-to-action links for user registration and login
- A feature highlights section
- Responsive and visually engaging design using Tailwind CSS

The page content fits seamlessly within the global layout provided by the root layout component.

---

### Styling and Responsiveness
- Tailwind CSS is used for all styling
- Global styles are defined in `globals.css`
- Responsive utilities ensure the layout works well across devices
- The navigation structure is designed to support mobile and desktop views

---

### Testing and Validation
The layout and navigation were tested to ensure:
- The Navbar appears consistently on all pages
- Page content renders correctly within the root layout
- Navigation links work as expected
- The layout adapts properly to different screen sizes

---

### Acceptance Criteria Status

-> Root layout with metadata: Completed
-> Navbar component created: Completed
-> Navigation links setup: Partially completed
-> Responsive hamburger menu planned: Completed
-> Global CSS / Tailwind setup: Completed
-> Layout tested: Completed
-> Navigation documented: Completed

### Summary
This implementation establishes a clean and reliable layout structure for the application. It ensures consistency across pages, simplifies future development.
